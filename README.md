# Food-101-Food-Detection
Food Classification and Nutrition Analysis with Food-101 Dataset

Overview

This project leverages the Food-101 dataset to build a machine learning model capable of recognizing food items from images. By identifying the food item, the system can then estimate the nutritional content and calorie information. This tool is designed to assist users in tracking their dietary intake by simply uploading a picture of their meal.


Features

Food Image Classification: Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model identifies the type of food from an uploaded image.
Calorie and Nutritional Information: Based on the recognized food item, the system provides an estimate of the calories and other nutritional values.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface for uploading food images and viewing results.


Dataset

The project utilizes the Food-101 dataset, which contains 101,000 images across 101 categories of food. Each category has 1,000 images, with 750 for training and 250 for testing. The dataset is pre-processed to fit the requirements of the model.
